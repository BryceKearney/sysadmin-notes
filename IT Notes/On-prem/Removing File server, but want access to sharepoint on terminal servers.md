The best method I found is using Onedrive, but remove it from downloading it locally.

Add it via Onedrive and sharepoint - Convert synced team site files to online-only files

Then you can push it via GPO

Or you can add a Microsoft Edge Sharepoint Icon 

Another method would be to Add local drives via RDP connection.
