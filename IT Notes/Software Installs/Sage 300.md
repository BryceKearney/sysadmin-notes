If you have Office connector, make sure to uninstall any 64 bit of O365 you may have and install 32 bit.

On local machine
name where sage lives \\\sage.
Timberline Office > 9.5 > accounting > WinInst > Install.exe, I would not recommend setup.exe

In the install it recommends to turn off anti-virus, which I found improved the speed of the install. For the install here it can take an hour and a half. While the shortest has been 10 minutes.

Recommend to run Desktop (Name of Sage application) as admin on first install.

If you have an error where it won't let you open Desktop, go to the folder and you can open the actual tabs like General Ledger(GL)
